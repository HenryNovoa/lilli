# Lilli

Lilliputian SQL-styled JSON ORM

* **Local:** Following its simplicity, you don't need a database provider to store and persist your data.
You just need a directory in your project to store all your JSON data files.
* **SQL-like:** Every JSON in your data directory works as a SQL table and the syntax in your queries will be similar to many other SQL ORMs.
* **Lilliputian:** Lilli is so tiny and simple you won't even notice is there!
